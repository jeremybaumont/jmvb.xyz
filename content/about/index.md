## About me

As a Software Engineer hailing from France, 
my journey led me to spend a significant portion of my life in The Netherlands and Australia. 
Along the way, I found love and married a phenomenal Dutch woman, 
with whom I am blessed to have two wondrous children. 
Currently, I call Australia my home.

In my quest to comprehend the inner workings of the world, 
I relish those precious moments when everything aligns, 
and perfect clarity emerges. 
This pursuit is a humble game, a recognition of the vastness of what I don't know, 
and a patient exploration of how each piece interconnectsâ€”one step at a time.
