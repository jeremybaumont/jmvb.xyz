  description = "I blog about what I struggled to understand. When I write about something, it force me to ask the hard questions, it helps to offload the cognitive load so I can build a mental model. When I try to explain my comprehension of something to the anonymous reader, it helps me to see the bigger picture. It is extremely hard at first, symptomatic that I don't master yet the topic. It is a journey, back and forth, from the machine to the text. Sometimes, I will loose the battle, and accept to come back to it later. And sometimes, I will be able to slow down and think clearly about it."
